# WorkforceOS

## Overview
WorkforceOS is a comprehensive workforce management operating system designed to automate HR functions for businesses. It offers features such as time tracking, automated invoice generation, smart hiring, compliance audit trails, and real-time analytics. The platform aims to provide significant cost savings by integrating various HR functions into a single system, envisioning branded features for a unified product identity. The project also focuses on monopolistic features to provide complete employee lifecycle management, granular role-based access control, and platform-level troubleshooting, justifying a premium pricing model.

## Recent Changes

### November 4, 2025 - Platform-Wide Fixes Complete

**Critical Settings Page Bug Fixed:**
- ✅ **Root Cause 1 (Auth)**: Workspace endpoints used OAuth middleware (`isAuthenticated`) but root admins use session-based auth
- ✅ **Root Cause 2 (Database)**: Missing column `feature_analyticsos_enabled` in workspaces table caused SQL errors
- ✅ **Solution**: Changed `/api/workspace` routes to use `requireAuth` (session-based) instead of `isAuthenticated` (OAuth)
- ✅ **Database Fix**: Added missing column `feature_analyticsos_enabled` to workspaces table
- ✅ **Field Mapping Fixed**: Added proper mapping between frontend field names (phone, website) and backend schema (companyPhone, companyWebsite)
- ✅ **New Fields Supported**: Now allows updating companyName, taxId, and address fields
- ✅ **Impact**: ALL users (including root admins and regular workspace owners) can now update organization settings

**UI Enhancements:**
- ✅ **All scrollbars hidden**: Global CSS fix removes scrollbars across entire app while maintaining scroll functionality
- ✅ **Chat input auto-focus**: Added autoFocus to chat input - users can start typing immediately without clicking first

### November 4, 2025 - Sales MVP Launch Ready
**Sales & Procurement System (DealOS™ + BidOS™) - Production Ready:**
- ✅ **Database Schema**: 7 tables created (deals, rfps, proposals, contacts, email_sequences, sequence_sends, deal_tasks) with proper multi-tenant workspace isolation
- ✅ **Sales Dashboard UI**: Unified command center at `/sales` showing pipeline value, active RFPs, hot leads with tabbed views (Pipeline, RFPs, Leads)
- ✅ **Secure Backend API**: Manager-level RBAC enforcement on all POST routes, Zod validation on request bodies, workspace isolation on all queries
- ✅ **Navigation Integration**: "DealOS™ Sales" added to Growth Family in sidebar with Target icon

**ScheduleOS™ Critical UX Fix:**
- ✅ **Interactive Grid**: Now ALWAYS shows clickable time slots (employee columns × time rows) even with zero employees/shifts - matching Sling UX
- ✅ **Empty State**: Added placeholder employee column with "Add Employee" button and clickable empty cells with "+ Add Shift" hover hints
- ✅ **Maintained Functionality**: Drag-and-drop, shift creation, and all existing features still work perfectly

**Architecture Review:** All changes architect-approved with no critical security, reliability, or quality issues. System ready for immediate sales operations.

## System Architecture
### Organization Principles
- **Modular OS Design**: Features are organized into branded "OS" modules (e.g., BillOS™, PayrollOS™, TrackOS™, TrainingOS™, BudgetOS™, EngagementOS™, IntegrationOS™).
- **Extend, Don't Rebuild**: Emphasizes building on existing systems.
- **Clean Code**: Code is organized by category/version for independent upgrades.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each feature domain has a single authoritative system.

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a CAD-style professional interface with a dark mode theme, emphasizing precision. It includes an application frame with a menu, toolbar, and status bar. The design is modern, professional, mobile-first, and utilizes corporate blue gradient accents. The official logo is a realistic neon-style "W" with glowing "OS" superscript. A universal transition system provides smooth visual feedback. Key UI components include tab-based navigation, collapsible sections, and mobile-optimized design elements. All acceptance forms have both accept and decline options.
