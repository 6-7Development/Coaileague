## Recent Changes (Nov 6, 2025)
### Root Admin Dashboard Reorganization - Better UX & No Duplicates ✅
**Comprehensive reorganization** addressing user complaints about cluttered layout and duplicate content:
- **Problem**: Quick actions hidden at bottom, duplicate organization search bars, redundant data tables
- **Solution**: Streamlined layout with logical top-to-bottom flow
- **Changes**:
  - **Quick Access now at TOP**: Moved from bottom to immediately below header, visible on both mobile (min-h-[60px]) and desktop (sm:min-h-[72px])
  - **Removed duplicate searches**: Consolidated from 3 search bars (User, Workspace, Organizations) to 2 (User + Workspace only)
  - **Deleted "Organizations Browser" card**: Was duplicate of workspace search with same backend query
  - **Removed duplicate "Quick Actions"**: Previously showing at both top AND bottom
  - **New layout order**: Header → Quick Access → Admin Controls → Profile → Metrics → System Health
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile (p-3, min-w-[68px]) and Desktop (sm:p-6, sm:min-w-[80px]) both supported
- **Result**: Cleaner interface, no redundant sections, quick actions prominently at top
- **Production Status**: Architect-approved, all API endpoints tested successfully

### Dashboard Duplication Fix - Clean Single View for All Users ✅
**Fixed Critical UX Issue** with duplicate dashboards showing redundant content:
- **Problem**: App.tsx was importing old `dashboard-compact.tsx` with mock data and duplicate sections
- **Solution**: Updated routing to use new clean `dashboard.tsx` with real notification center
- **Changes**:
  - Updated App.tsx import from `@/pages/dashboard-compact` to `@/pages/dashboard`
  - Removed dashboard-compact.tsx file completely
  - All non-root users now see single clean dashboard view
- **Result**: Users no longer see multiple quick actions, multiple data tables, or redundant tools
- **Verified**: Employee, manager, and owner roles all see streamlined dashboard
- **Root Admins**: Unchanged - root-admin-dashboard.tsx remains separate for platform administration
- **Production Status**: Architect-approved, all user roles tested successfully
